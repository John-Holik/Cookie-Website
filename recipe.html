    <h3>Baking Instructions</h3>
    <!--Ordered List-->
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven</strong><br>
            Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or lightly grease them.</li>

        <li><strong>Mix the Wet Ingredients</strong><br>
            In a large bowl, use a mixer to beat 1 cup of softened butter, ¾ cup of granulated sugar, and ¾ cup of brown
            sugar until
            the mixture is creamy and smooth (about 2-3 minutes).
            Add 2 eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then mix in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.</li>

        <li><strong>Combine the Dry Ingredients</strong><br>
            In a separate bowl, whisk together 2 ¼ cups of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon of baking soda, and ½ teaspoon
            of salt.</li>

        <li><strong>Mix Wet and Dry Ingredients</strong><br>
            Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, beating on low speed until fully combined. The dough
            will be
            thick.</li>

        <li><strong>Fold in Chocolate Chips</strong><br>
            Stir in 2 cups of chocolate chips (and 1 cup of nuts if using) with a spatula or wooden spoon until evenly
            distributed.</li>

        <li><strong>Shape the Cookies</strong><br>
            Scoop tablespoon-sized portions of dough and drop them onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2
            inches
            apart.</li>

        <li><strong>Bake</strong><br>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers look
            slightly soft.</li>

        <li><strong>Cool the Cookies</strong><br>
            Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for about 2 minutes, then transfer them to wire racks to cool
            completely.</li>

    </ol>
